## Set Up

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install CPFcluster.

```bash
pip install CPFcluster
```
To download the data sets, either use the links given in data/Datasets.md or, to download all data sets: 

```bash
sh download_data.sh
```
## Run

To run CPFcluster on the downloaded data:

```bash
sh bin/run_downloaded.sh
```
The above script will save cluster labels to a csv file in a new 'results' folder. Also included is a brief script to execute code on a synthetic numeric data set which demonstrates the 'train' function of the CPFclustering class. To execute:

```bash 
python bin.run_synthetic.py
```
All source code for the method is available from [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or in the /src folder.
