## The `create_neighbor_adjacency_matrix` function accepts a two-column numpy array, where the first column is latitude and the second column is longitude.

- `create_neighbor_adjacency_matrix(coords, n_neighbors=15)`: Create a 0/1 adjacency matrix where 1 indicates that a point is among the k-nearest neighbors of another point.<br>  
  - `coords` *(np.ndarray)*: numpy array of shape `(n_samples, 2)` with latitude/longitude in degrees.
  - `n_neighbors` *(int)*: number of nearest neighbors to consider.
  - **Returns**:
    - `adjacency_matrix`: binary numpy array of shape `(n_samples, n_samples)`.


## The `fit` function has one additional argument: `geo_neighbor_adjacency_matrix`.

- `fit(X, geo_neighbor_adjacency_matrix)`: Apply the CPF method to the input data X. <br>  
  - `X` *(np.ndarray)*: input data of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.
  - `geo_neighbor_adjacency_matrix` *(np.ndarray)*: binary numpy array of shape `(n_samples, n_samples)`.
  - **Returns**:
    - None. Update the instance attributes with identified cluster labels. Outliers are labeled as `-1`.


## The `build_CCgraph` function has one additional argument: `geo_neighbor_adjacency_matrix`.

- `build_CCgraph(X, geo_neighbor_adjacency_matrix, min_samples, cutoff, n_jobs, distance_metric='euclidean')`: Construct the k-NN graph and extract the connected components. <br>
